## ‚ùì About
This tool let your server's users to get accounts through a secure and advanced system.  
The accounts are saved in txt files, so you do not have to deal with databases.  
You can create a service, and generate accounts for that service.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
**Service creation**   
You have to create the services you provide account for. (netflix, etc..), use the command `/create`, this will create a txt file
with the name of the service you choosed, you can also create it manually.  
  
**Adding Accounts**  
After you created a service, you have to add accounts to it, you just have to use the command `/add` followed by username and password
in the next syntax username:password, and then the service's name  
  
**Receiving accounts**  
The user needs just to run the command `/gen` followed by the service's name and he will receive the account in DM.  
There is a 15 minutes cooldown that you can edit in the source code  
  
**Restocking accounts**  
After you filled the txt with all the accounts you want, you can use the command `/restock` followed by the service name to alert the users that the service has been restocked

```js 
if (message.channel.id === "Channel_ID")
```
with the id of the channel you want the bot to work in.
