## ❓ Plan Differences
Premium Version:
- Online Dashboard Connected to Discord, to manage accounts, users and settings, this will let you have control over the bot in a easier way instead of discord commands
- Can Add multiple accounts (See image below), With basic version you can add only 1 account per time with `/addone` command
- Web and Bot hosted 100% by me, you do not need to deal with codes or bots


## ⚙️ How it works
**Adding Accounts**  
Premium: Navigate to the dashboard and then on the side bar click on "Add account", there you can add multiple accounts for the service you want

Basic: You can add account to your service through the command `/addone` followed by the service and then the username and password in this syntax: username:password

**Getting Logs of generated Accounts**  
Premium: Navigate to the "View Logs" section on the Dashboard

Basic: You can't 

**Blocking User from generating account**  
Premium: Navigate to the "Admin Section" section on the Dashboard and block the user 

Basic: You can't 
  
**Receiving accounts**  
The user needs just to run the command `/gen` followed by the service's name and he will receive the account in DM.
There is a 15 minutes cooldown by default, if you have the basic bot, it can be changed in settings.json or through the command.
If you have the premium one, navigate to the "Bot Settings" section and change it from there
